##1.0.1
  06/18/2014 - [Levon Becker](mailto:levon.becker@nike.com)

* Removed DNS reverse lookup because there are not DNS reverse records for our VMs
* Added DNS Cross Reference Sheet that I pulled from Skittles on Sharepoint. Correct or add to the JSON as needed.
* Changed default settings JSON path to use relative path. So if it's in the same path as the Ruby script it should pick it up.

* Release
